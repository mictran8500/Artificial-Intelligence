Implemented both the best-first and the A* search algorithms to search for a solution to the 8-puzzle. 
Three different heuristics (Hamming distance, Manhattan distance, mean(h1,h2)) where implemented for evaluating states in the state space.
Each of these three heuristics, along with the search algorithms, were tested on five different initial states.
The number of steps, number of iterations, and final path to the goal are calculated and outputted.
