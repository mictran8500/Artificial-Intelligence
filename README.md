# Artificial-Intelligence
This repository includes projects and coding assignments from my artificial intelligence course. (Course currently in progress so more projects and code will be uploaded as they are completed).

INCLUDES CODE FOR:

Solution for the 8-puzzle problem using A* search and best-first search. Implemented three different heuristic functions for evaluation (Hamming distance, Manhattan distance, mean (h1, h2))

Solution for the 8-Queens problem using a Genetic Algorithm.
